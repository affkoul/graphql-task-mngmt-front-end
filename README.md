# graphql-task-mngmt-front-end
GraphQL based task management web app front-end

1. Clone this repository.

2. Run npm install at the root of the project to install all required dependencies.

3. Open the file App.js and configure the client uri (back-end GraphQL API endpoint) properly.

4. Open the file Dockerfile (for docker contenerization) and configure as you wish to deploy on your server.

5. Open the file doker-compose.yml (for docker contenerization) and configure per your deployment requirements. I had to comment out the front-end service for I served it as static files. Go ahead and uncomment it per your need.

6. Run npm run start at the root of the project to start the front-end OR use the docker command, docker-compose up, to fire up all services.

7. And that's it!
